## ðŸ“– Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. This repository aims to provide clear examples of these patterns to help developers understand and implement them in their own projects.

## ðŸš€ Design Patterns Included

This repository includes the following design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - Example: `ZooKeeper.java`

2. **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - Example: `WeatherStation.java`

3. **Factory Method Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - Example: `VehicleFactory.java`

4. **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
   - Example: `NavigationApp.java`

5. **Decorator Pattern**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
   - Example: `CoffeeDecorator.java`
